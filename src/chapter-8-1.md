**7. Employee Feedback and Testimonials**
-----------------------------------------

Collect employee feedback and testimonials about their experiences with stress reduction initiatives:

* Analyze KPI trends over time to assess the long-term impact of strategies.

**Data Analysis and Insights**
------------------------------

Use data analysis tools and techniques to derive insights from the collected data:

* Compare data across different departments, teams, or demographics to pinpoint areas needing improvement.

**Actionable Improvements**
---------------------------

Utilize insights gained from evaluation techniques to drive actionable improvements:

* Modify and refine stress reduction strategies based on identified strengths and weaknesses.
