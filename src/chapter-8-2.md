Types of KPIs

There are several types of KPIs that organizations can use to measure and evaluate stress reduction effectiveness. These include:

Absenteeism rates can provide insight into the impact of stress on employee attendance. Organizations should track absenteeism rates and adjust stress reduction strategies as needed to reduce the number of missed workdays.

### Turnover Rates

Turnover rates can provide insight into the impact of stress on employee retention. High turnover rates may be a sign of a stressful workplace environment, indicating a need for more effective stress reduction strategies.

### Productivity Levels

Productivity levels can provide insight into the impact of stress on employee performance. By tracking productivity levels, organizations can identify areas where stress reduction efforts may be needed to improve performance.

### Employee Satisfaction

Employee satisfaction surveys can provide valuable feedback on the effectiveness of stress reduction strategies and overall workplace environment. Organizations should regularly gather feedback from employees and use it to guide ongoing stress reduction initiatives.

Setting Realistic Targets

Setting realistic targets for KPIs is essential for ensuring that stress reduction strategies are effective and achievable. Targets should be based on realistic expectations and informed by ongoing evaluation and feedback from employees.
